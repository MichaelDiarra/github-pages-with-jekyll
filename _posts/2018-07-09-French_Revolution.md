The French Revolution (French: Révolution française [ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛːz]) was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France
and its colonies that lasted from 1789 until 1799. 
It was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. 
The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, catalyzed violent periods of political turmoil, 
and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon who brought many of its principles to areas he conquered in Western Europe 
and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history,
triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies.
